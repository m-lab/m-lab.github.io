    "\n",
    "We are in a situation that is an almost textbook case for statistical analaysis:\n",
    "1. We have a lot of data\n",
    "2. We have a question of interest (is the new platform worse than the old platform?)\n",
    "3. We have a default action (roll out the new platform)\n",
    "\n",
    "In developing an analysis, we want to be congnizant of a few important facts:\n",
    "1. Internet performance is differently variable in different regions of the\n",
    "   world.\n",
    "2. Not all machines at a site are used equally. In particular, we know of some\n",

    "   never run a test to `ndt.iupui.mlab2.lax03` or `ndt.iupui.mlab3.lax03`.\n",
    "3. The kubernetes platform is not rolled out to any `mlab1` machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our needs and our constraints lead to the following per-site analysis method to\n",

    "Let us assume that for this site, the `mlab2` machine uses PlanetLab, vservers,\n",
    "and web100 (a PL machine) and the `mlab3` machine uses Kubernetes, Docker, and tcp-info (a k8s machine).\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean (both arithmetic mean and log mean) download and upload experienced by\n",
    "   all NDT clients that connected to `mlab2` or `mlab3` during the month of\n",
    "   September.  If the means for the new platform are both not worse\n",
    "   than the means for the old platform, then we are done.  The\n",
    "   performance of the new platform at that site does not constitute a\n",
    "   regression.\n",
    "2. If a mean has regressed at any site, then we calculate a \"noise floor\" for the site by doing the same\n",
    "   analysis for January, February, ..., June of 2019.  During those months, all\n",
    "   the `mlab3` machines were controlled by the old platform and as such, our\n",

    "   floor (between the old and the old) to see whether it is within historical\n",
    "   norms.  If we are 95% confident that the new performance differential is\n",
    "   within historical norms, then we can conclude that the new performance at the\n",
    "   site does not constitue a regression.\n",
    "3. If the regression in performance is outside of historical norms, we conduct\n",
    "   an investigation to discover why.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Spoiler alert: every analysis we performed ended after step 1, because no means got worse)\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this analysis method, we set about investigating M-Lab's Bigquery NDT data.  When a single client endpoint has tested against a server multiple times, we choose a random successful result to prevent any individual network endpoint from contributing too much to the final analysis. We then compare the mean and median of these \"monthly bests\" between the PL and k8s.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first begin by constructing a basic query that filters out some bad-looking data and then creates two joinable tables containing per-site performance at the minimum, 1%, 2%, ..., 98%, 99%, and maximum levels as well as per-site average performance.  Once we have both of these, we conduct two analyses: a visual one and a quantitative one."

Because no mean at any site for uploads or downloads has gotten worse, it is safe to conclude that the new platform is not worse than the old platform, and that we should feel confident in rolling it out gradually to the rest of the fleet.
