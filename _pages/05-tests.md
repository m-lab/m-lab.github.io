# Internet Measurement Tests

M-Lab hosts a number of measurement tests, allowing you to check for everything from network speed and latency to blocking and throttling. Explore them below, and run a test to learn more about your connection.

All tests hosted on M-Lab only perform active measurements. This means that tests only run when people decide to run them. They do not passively monitor your connection. M-Lab hosted tests do not download or upload files to or from your device. Instead tests measure the way in which the network responds to a synthetic stream of data that is generated by the individual test specifically for the purpose of measurement. The tests do not collect information about your other Internet traffic, such as your emails or web searches, or any personally identifiable information. For more information, see our [privacy policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy).

* All data collected will be made publicly available, including IP addresses.
* All tests are open source and created by researchers.
