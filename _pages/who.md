# Who We Are

M-Lab is an open source project with contributors from civil society organizations, educational institutions, and private sector companies, and is a fiscally sponsored project of Code for Science & Society.

M-Lab operates as a community-based effort. We currently receive assistance from M-Lab supporting partners, and we welcome others who would like to contribute to the platform's growth and success. In order for M-Lab to achieve its objectives, it depends on the participation of additional companies, institutions, and researchers. Learn how to [get involved]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute).
