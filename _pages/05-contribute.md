# Supporting or Contributing to M-Lab

M-Lab welcomes the participation of individuals and researchers, as well as companies, organizations or other institutions, who would like to help expand the platform and ensure its growth and success.

## Individuals

For individuals, the best way to support M-Lab is to [regularly use our tests]({{ site.baseurl }}/tests). You gain the benefit of understanding more about your connection to the Internet, and the research community and the public benefits from the resulting public data.

## Researchers

M-Lab welcomes researchers who want to dig into the M-Lab data, providing documentation and best-effort email support. If you are interested in working with M-Lab data in your research, please review our [data documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/data) to help get you started and [contact us](mailto:support@measurementlab.net) with any questions. We also suggest you join our [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/#!forum/discuss) for news and announcements.

Researchers developing and maintaining Open Source network measurement tests may apply to host a new test on M-Lab. If your project fits within M-Lab's guidelines and principles, we invite you to [apply for M-Lab hosting](https://docs.google.com/a/opentechinstitute.org/forms/d/1Dz-d8bs92ltlKKxWDCoi2nFC6wmBrBq6vrLIwhYyiDM/viewform).
