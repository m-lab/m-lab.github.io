## What are cookies?

Cookies are text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and store certain information about Site usage. They are useful because they allow websites to recognize a user's device. They are then returned to the original website on each subsequent visit or to any other website that recognizes them. The term “cookie” is used in this Notice in the broad sense to include all similar techniques and technology, including web beacons and log files.

## Cookie management

You can exercise your preference to receive all types of cookies by managing cookies from your web browser.
