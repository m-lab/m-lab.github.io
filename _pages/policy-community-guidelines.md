# M-Lab Community Guidelines

To facilitate constructive conversation we ask that all participants respect our
community guidelines within M-Lab hosted forums including community calls, pull requests
and our discuss@ mailing list:

* Communicate with courtesy and respect for one another and each other’s work
* Approach complex topics with patience and an open mind
* Treat one another as you would in “real life”

The M-Lab team will oversee any hosted forums and maintain the right to moderate
them if necessary.
