# Explorations of NDT Data
As we have [outlined on our blog][research-recommend], analyses using NDT data
should account for things like multimodal distributions, client bias,
and population drift, and use histogram and logarithmic scales instead of basic statistics.

Developing robust analyses, however, typically **does** entail examining basic,
descriptive statistics of a dataset. To support our wide-ranging communities,
here we provide some basic, descriptive statistics of NDT data, visualized in
Google DataStudio reports. DataStudio reports should be considered advisory,
meaning you should use them in your exploratory analyses only, leading you to more robust
methods to make your analyses suitable for publication.
