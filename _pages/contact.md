We also maintain a user group, [M-Lab Discuss](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/#!forum/discuss), where the community of M-Lab users interact. Joining this group also provides you free access to our data, so we highly recommend that you join this list and ask questions.

M-Lab operates as a community-based effort, receiving in-kind, staffing, and direct support from our partners. Our focus is providing a stable, globally distributed platform from which researchers, public policy makers, and the public can get data on the state and performance of the Internet and to make our tests' data publicly available for analysis, policy making, and monitoring. This is an immense effort conducted by a small number of people. If you would like to contribute to this effort, please learn how you or your organization can [get involved]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/).
