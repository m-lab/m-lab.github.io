M-Lab operates as a community-based effort, receiving in-kind, staffing and direct support from our partners. Our focus is providing a stable, globally distributed platform from which researchers, public policy makers and the public can get data on the state and performance of the Internet and to make our tests' data publicly available for analysis, policy making, and monitoring. This is an immense effort conducted by a small number people. If you would like to contribute to this effort,  please learn how you or your organization can [get involved]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/).
