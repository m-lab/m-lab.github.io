Founded in 2008, SamKnows works alongside governments, consumers, ISPs, academics and industry to accurately measure fixed and mobile broadband to help improve global Internet performance. The SamKnows performance testing platform is used by the USA's Federal Communications Commission (FCC), European Commission, UK government (Ofcom), Brazilian government (Anatel), Singapore's IDA and other government-backed studies worldwide.

SamKnows infrastructure includes off-net test servers hosted by M-Lab, and the M-Lab and SamKnows teams coordinate regularly to support the various regulatory reporting periods of data collection conducted by SamKnows.
