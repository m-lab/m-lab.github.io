# SamKnows

From 2009-2019, M-Lab donated server resources to the [FCC Measuring Broadband America program](https://www.fcc.gov/general/measuring-broadband-america){:target="_blank"}, providing its contractor, SamKnows, with off-net hosting points for the annual study. In late 2019 with the launch of [M-Lab 2.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/the-platform-has-landed/), M-Lab began enforcing our long-standing policy requirements for all experiments hosted on the M-Lab Platform to be open source and to publish openly licensed data. While the [FCC MBA program communicates its alignment with M-Lab's open source policies](https://www.fcc.gov/general/measuring-broadband-america-open-methodology){:target="_blank"}, SamKnows declined the opportunity to continue using the M-Lab platform due to our requirement for open source code.
