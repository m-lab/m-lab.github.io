# SamKnows

From 2009-2019, M-Lab donated server resources to the [FCC Measuring Broadband America program](https://www.fcc.gov/general/measuring-broadband-america){:target="_blank"}, providing its contractor, SamKnows, with off-net hosting locations for the annual study. In late 2019, we launched [M-Lab 2.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/the-platform-has-landed/), which enforces, through technical means, our long-standing open source requirement by requiring an open source Docker container that can be built and publicly archived by M-Lab. SamKnows has declined to provide an open source server, so we have not been able to host their experiment since the close of the 2019 MBA program.
