# ShaperProbe

**ShaperProbe was decommissioned on 5/11/2015. However, data collected by ShaperProbe while hosted with M-Lab is available at the link below.**

ShaperProbe attempted to measure traffic shaping, which is the practice of dropping an ISP customer's throughput rate after they have exceeded a certain limit, whether or not that limit is known to the customer.

ShaperProbe was a research prototype developed by Georgia Tech graduate student Partha Kanuparthy as a proof-of-concept for his research in network measurement. After Partha graduated, it became practically difficult to maintain the tool and support its deployment on M-Lab. We encourage the open-source community to adopt ShaperProbe either as a stand-alone tool (as it operated on M-Lab) or as an algorithm implemented in other network inference applications/tools.

For any questions regarding the code/tool, please contact Partha Kanuparthy (kvbp2k@gmail.com) or Constantine Dovrolis (constantine@gatech.edu).
