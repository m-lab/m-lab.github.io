# TCP INFO

TCP measures the network as part of its normal operation. All transport protocols, including TCP, measure the network to determine how much data to send and when to optimally fill the network. Sending too much data or sending it too fast results in congestion, network queue overflows and discarded packets; sending data too slowly results in under-filled networks and wasted idle capacity. TCP INFO exposes these built in measurements for diagnostics and other applications.

M-Lab uses TCP INFO to collect statistics about every TCP connection used by each hosted measurement service running on the M-Lab platform. TCP INFO runs as a "side" addition to other tools, taking advantage of TCP connections generated by incoming tests to M-Lab.

## Source code for M-Lab's TCP INFO statistics collector

## Citing the M-Lab TCP INFO Dataset

Please cite this data set as follows: **The M-Lab TCP INFO Data Set, &lt;date range used&gt;. https://measurementlab.net/tests/tcp-info**

## TCP INFO Data in Raw Format

Data collected by TCP INFO is available in raw format in Google Cloud Storage for each hosted measurement service:

* M-Lab Host Server - [https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/host/tcpinfo/](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/host/tcpinfo/){:target="
_blank"}
* NDT - [https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/ndt/tcpinfo/](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/ndt/tcpinfo/){:target="
_blank"}
* Neubot - [https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/neubot/tcpinfo/](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/neubot/tcpinfo/){:target="

* WeHe- [https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/wehe/tcpinfo/](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/wehe/tcpinfo/){:target="

## TCP INFO Data in BigQuery

M-Lab parses all TCP INFO data into BigQuery tables and views, and makes query access available for free. Find out more about how to get access on our [BigQuery QuickStart page]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs/bq/quickstart/).

BigQuery Tables/Views for TCP INFO Data:

* M-Lab Host Server TCP INFO data - Coming soon: _measurement-lab.host.tcpinfo_
* NDT TCP INFO data - [measurement-lab.ndt.tcpinfo](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery&folder&p=measurement-lab&d=ndt&t=tcpinfo&page=table){:target="_blank"}
* Neubot TCP INFO data - Coming soon: _measurement-lab.neubot.tcpinfo_
* WeHe TCP INFO data - Coming soon: _measurement-lab.wehe.tcpinfo_

## TCP INFO Schema

**Note:** The tcpinfo schema has not yet been migrated to standard columns. Until that time, this schema should be considered temporary or unstable.
