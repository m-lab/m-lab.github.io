# Packet Header Service (PCAP)

The M-Lab [packet-headers service](https://github.com/m-lab/packet-headers){:target="_blank"} provides a binary which collects packet headers for all incoming TCP flows and saves each stream of packet captures into a per-stream .pcap file where the filename is the [UUID](https://github.com/m-lab/uuid){:target="_blank"} of the TCP flow. It only saves the packet headers, and it supports (with a command-line flag) IP anonymity for the saved addresses.

M-Lab uses TCP INFO to collect statistics about every TCP connection used by each hosted measurement service running on the M-Lab platform. TCP INFO runs as a "side" addition to other tools, taking advantage of TCP connections generated by incoming tests to M-Lab.
