# ndt5 Protocol - NDT (Network Diagnostic Tool)

The ndt5 protocol is _description of ndt5_

NDT data using the ndt5 protocol prior to **##DATE##** was collected using the Web100 Linux kernel patch to provide access to a rich set of TCP information for each NDT test. NDT data prior to **##DATE##** can be found in the [NDT web100 (legacy) dataset]({{ site.baseurl }}/tests/ndt/web100).

NDT data using the ndt5 protocol collected on or after **##DATE##** uses [tcp-info]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn) for all TCP metrics, and is described in more detail on this page.
