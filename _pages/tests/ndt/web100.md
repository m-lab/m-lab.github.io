# web100 - NDT (Network Diagnostic Tool)

web100 is the NDT protocol currently used by M-Lab. As a part of M-Lab's platform upgrade to be completed by the end of 2019, [ndt-server](https://github.com/m-lab/ndt-server/){:target="_blank"} will replace the current web100-based NDT server,  provide the [ndt5 protocol]({{ site.baseurl }}/tests/ndt/ndt5) for backward compatibility with current clients, and will add the ndt7 protocol for future client use.

NDT data using the web100 protocol is collected using the [Web100 Linux kernel](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=956993.957002){:target="_blank"} patch to provide access to a rich set of TCP information for each NDT test.

web100 NDT data can be found in the [NDT web100 dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=measurement-lab&folder&organizationId=433637338589&p=measurement-lab&d=ndt&t=web100&page=table){:target="_blank"}.

## Equivalent BigQuery and Web100 Field Types

The file [tcp-kis.txt](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tcp-kis.txt){:target="_blank"} defines each Web100 variable with a specific [SNMP type](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4898){:target="_blank"}. The table below shows how to map each SNMP type to a BigQuery type.

<div class="table-responsive" markdown="1">

| BigQuery Type |  Corresponding SNMP Type |
| ------------- | -------------------------|
| `integer`     |  `Integer32`, `Integer`, `INTEGER`, `Gauge32`, `ZeroBasedCounter32`, `Unsigned32`, `Unsigned16`, `Counter32`, `ZeroBasedCounter64` |
| `string`      |  `Ip_Address`            |
| `bool`        |  `TruthValue`            |

## Blacklist Flags Field

The field `blacklist_flags` was used to mark test affected by the "switch discard issue" [identified in 2015-2016]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/traffic-microbursts-and-their-effect-on-internet-measurement). M-Lab NDT data from 2010-01-01 to 2015-10-02 was marked using this field. M-Lab may use the field for other use cases in the future for tests potentially impacted by site configuration issues, or otherwise communicate potentially relevant information about the state of the platform at the time of the test.

Currently, the following values are present in NDT data from 2010-01-01 to 2015-10-02 in these fields:

<div class="table-responsive" markdown="1">

| Field Name | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `blacklist_flags` or `anomalies.blacklist_flags` | `0` or `NULL` | unaffected tests |
| | `1` | tests affected by switch discards |
| | `2` | tests not shown to be unaffected by switch discards |
