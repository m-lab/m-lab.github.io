# web100 (legacy ndt) - NDT (Network Diagnostic Tool)

web100 is the now deprecated, legacy protocol used by NDT until **##DATE##**.

NDT data using the web100 protocol was collected prior to **##DATE##** using the Web100 Linux kernel patch to provide access to a rich set of TCP information for each NDT test.

NDT data prior to **##DATE##** can be found in the [NDT web100 (legacy) dataset]({{ site.baseurl }}/tests/ndt/web100).

## Equivalent BigQuery and Web100 Field Types

The file [tcp-kis.txt](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tcp-kis.txt){:target="_blank"} defines each Web100 variable with a specific [SNMP type](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4898){:target="_blank"}. The table below shows how to map each SNMP type to a BigQuery type.

<div class="table-responsive" markdown="1">

| BigQuery Type |  Corresponding SNMP Type |
| ------------- | -------------------------|
| `integer`     |  `Integer32`, `Integer`, `INTEGER`, `Gauge32`, `ZeroBasedCounter32`, `Unsigned32`, `Unsigned16`, `Counter32`, `ZeroBasedCounter64` |
| `string`      |  `Ip_Address`            |
| `bool`        |  `TruthValue`            |

## Blacklist Flags Field

The field `blacklist_flags` was used to mark test affected by the "switch discard issue" [identified in 2015-2016]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/traffic-microbursts-and-their-effect-on-internet-measurement). M-Lab NDT data from 2010-01-01 to 2015-10-02 was marked using this field. M-Lab may use the field for other use cases in the future for tests potentially impacted by site configuration issues, or otherwise communicate potentially relevant information about the state of the platform at the time of the test.

Currently, the following values are present in NDT data from 2010-01-01 to 2015-10-02 in these fields:

<div class="table-responsive" markdown="1">

| Field Name | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `blacklist_flags` or `anomalies.blacklist_flags` | `0` or `NULL` | unaffected tests |
| | `1` | tests affected by switch discards |
| | `2` | tests not shown to be unaffected by switch discards |
