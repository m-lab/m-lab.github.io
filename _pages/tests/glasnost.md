# Glasnost

**Glasnost was decommissioned on 07/7/2017. However, the source code, data and data analysis code is still available at the link provided below.**

Glasnost attempted to detect whether your Internet service provider (ISP) was performing application-specific traffic shaping. Glasnost allowed a user to test whether an ISP was throttling or blocking email, HTTP, SSH, Flash Video, and P2P applications such as BitTorrent.

Please cite this data set as follows: **The M-Lab Glasnost Data Set, &lt;date range used&gt;. https://measurementlab.net/tests/glasnost**
