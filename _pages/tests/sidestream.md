# SideStream

SideStream collects statistics about the TCP connections used by the measurement tools running on the M-Lab platform. SideStream runs as a "side" addition to other tools, taking advantage of TCP connections generated by incoming tests to M-Lab.

Please cite this data set as follows: The M-Lab SideStream Data Set, &lt;date range used&gt;. https://measurementlab.net/tests/sidestream

**Data** collected by SideStream is available:

* in raw format at [https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/sidestream/](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/sidestream/).

* in BigQuery at [https://www.measurementlab.net/data/docs/bq/quickstart/]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs/bq/quickstart/).
