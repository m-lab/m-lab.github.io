# Neubot

Neubot (the network neutrality bot) was a free software Internet bot, developed and maintained by the Nexa Center for Internet & Society, that gathered network performance data useful to investigate network neutrality. The Neubot client was [retired in January 2019](http://www.neubot.org/2019/01/retiring-neubot-client.html){:target="_blank"}. If you are interested in running tests similar to Neubot, M-Lab recommends using [OONI Probe](https://ooni.torproject.org/install/){:target="_blank"}. _M-Lab will continue hosting the Neubot server until our [platform modernization project]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/modernizing-mlab/#modernizing-the-m-lab-platform) is completed, after which it will be retired._
