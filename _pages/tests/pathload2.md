# Pathload2

**Pathload2 was decommissioned on 12/21/2012. The source code and the data are still available at the links provided below.**

Pathload2 determined the available bandwidth of an Internet connection, in both upstream and downstream directions. Unlike many other speed tests, Pathload2 used active probing methodologies to estimate available bandwidth in a way that did not depend on a specific protocol or application. The available bandwidth is the maximum bit rate that can be sent to a network link before it gets congested.
