As we have [outlined on our blog][research-recommend], analyses using NDT data
should account for things like multimodal distributions, client bias,
and population drift, and use histogram and logarithmic scales instead of basic statistics.

Developing robust analyses, however, typically **does** begin by examining basic,
descriptive statistics of a dataset. To support our wide-ranging communities,
here we provide some basic, descriptive statistics of NDT data, visualized in
Google DataStudio reports. 

These reports should be considered advisory, meaning that they should be used in
exploratory analyses only, leading to more robust methods to make your analyses
suitable for publication.
