As we have [outlined on our blog][research-recommend], analyses using NDT data
should account for things like multimodal distributions, client bias,
and population drift, and use histogram and logarithmic scales instead of basic
statistics. Developing robust analyses, however, typically **begins** by examining basic,
descriptive statistics of a dataset.

To support our wide-ranging communities, here we provide advisory statistics of
NDT data visualized in Google DataStudio reports. These reports use statistics
generated by our [stats-pipeline](https://github.com/m-lab/stats-pipeline/#readme) service, unless otherwise noted.
