### Analysis of Impartial Quality Measurements on Indian Broadband Connections
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
Broadband Internet user base is growing at an exponential pace in India. The market pressures are forcing the Internet service providers (ISPs) to sell their service offerings aggressively, resulting in a growing discrepancy between consumer expectations and service offerings from the ISPs. This discrepancy is often evident in experienced vs offered Internet connection service. This study examines the Quality of Service (QoS) variations for Internet connections of the Indian broadband users.

### CUSUM Anomaly Detection
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
The CUSUM anomaly detection (CAD) method is based on CUSUM statistical process control charts. CAD is used to detect anomalous subsequences of a time series that show a subtle shift in the mean relative to the context of the sequence itself. CAD was applied in order to look for anomalies in M­Lab’s database of Network Diagnostic Test (NDT) results.

### Public QoS and Net Neutrality Measurements: Current Status and Challenges Toward Exploitable Results
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
The interest for Quality of Service (QoS) measurements in the Internet has exceeded the boundaries of research laboratories and passed into the public domain. The Internet is treated as a public utility, and users are given the right to access Internet content of their choice at an adequate quality. This coincides with the sustained interest for net neutrality (NN), basic safeguards for which are being taken in countries all over the world. Today, several tools have become available that empower end-users to measure the performance of their Internet connection and detect NN violations. However, the value that end-users obtain with these measurements is still small and the results are not being exploited satisfactorily by regulatory authorities, policy makers, and consumers. In this article, we perform a detailed review of the tools that are currently available for public QoS and NN measurements and explore three challenges that must be met in order to extract more value from the results: (a) Harmonization of measurement methodologies of basic performance parameters (throughput, delay, jitter, and packet loss); (b) the creation of a toolbox for detecting and monitoring NN violations; and (c) the use of a proper sampling plan for producing estimates over population groups.

### European capability for situational awareness
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
This study examines the field of Internet and Human Rights and more specifically, Internet Censorship measurement. The European Commission DG-Connect commissioned this study to assess the potential for a European Capability for Situational Awareness that continuously monitors and analyses the existence of Internet interference in combination with Human Rights Violations and recommend on potential implementation of such an ECSA. A [proof-of-concept website](https://ecsa.chokepointproject.net){:target="_blank"} was produced along with this report.

### Analysis of End-User QoE in Community Networks
{:.no_toc}

{:.paper-description}
Community networks are a potential model for the Future Internet, where the users form and operate the network instead of a central, commercial entity. Socio-economic studies show that community networks are an excellent model to develop networking infrastructure commons (as common-pool resources or public goods) that promote sustainable development, with greater effects in less developed areas. The performance of parts of community networks has been studied extensively, often focusing on routing protocols or applications on top of community networks. This work focuses on the end-to-end quality of Internet access in community networks, as a validation of the technical applicability of this concept in under-served regions.
