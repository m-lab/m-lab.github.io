M-Lab seeks to make the open data collected by users our measurement services accessible and useful to general audiences and the research community. In this section of our site, we provide pre-aggregated statistics based on our team's best understanding and methods of analyses. More exploratory analyses are provided on the "Data Exploration" page.

Below we provide the first iteration of statistics from the NDT measurement service.
