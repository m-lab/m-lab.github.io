# M-Lab Statistics

M-Lab seeks to make the open data collected by users our measurement services
accessible and useful to general audiences and the research community. In this
section of our site, we provide pre-aggregated statistics of the NDT dataset
based on our team's best understanding and methods of analyses. More exploratory
analyses are provided on the "Data Exploration" page.

Below we provide the first iteration of statistics from the NDT measurement
service. Our `stats-pipeline` service generates these statistics. To learn more
about the methods used to generate these statistics, please review the
documentation in our [`stats-pipeline`](https://github.com/m-lab/stats-pipeline/blob/master/README.md) repository.
