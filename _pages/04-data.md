# Overview

M-Lab publishes its test data in two forms:

* Google Cloud Storage
  * M-Lab publishes raw output from its measurement tools on Google Cloud Storage as file archives.
  * See [M-Lab Google Cloud Storage documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs/gcs) for more information.
* Google BigQuery
  * M-Lab parses data for a subset of its tools and publishes the data on BigQuery so that users can run SQL queries on the data.
  * See [M-Lab BigQuery QuickStart]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs/bq/quickstart) for more information.

There is typically at least a 24-hour delay between data collection and data publication.
