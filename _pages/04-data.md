# Overview

Measurement data from experiments hosted on M-Lab, and processed via the ETL pipeline, are published in two forms:

* Google Cloud Storage
  * M-Lab publishes raw output from its measurement tools on Google Cloud Storage as file archives.
  * See [M-Lab Google Cloud Storage documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs/gcs) for more information.
* Google BigQuery
  * M-Lab parses data for a subset of its tools and publishes the data on BigQuery so that users can run SQL queries on the data.
  * See [M-Lab BigQuery QuickStart]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs/bq/quickstart) for more information.

There is typically at least a 24-hour delay between data collection and data publication. Below we provide links to data for our **Active tests** and archival data from **Inactive tests**.

M-Lab also publishes public data sets about the M-Lab Platform, listed below.

Lastly, some M-Lab hosted tests do not use our ETL pipeline. Data for these tests are published independently by the test developers.

## Current Active Data Sets

### Measurement Data (Active Tests)

#### ETL Processed

* [Neubot](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/neubot/){:target="_blank"}
  * Neubot measures the Internet in order to gather data useful to study broadband performance, network neutrality, and Internet censorship.
  * More information is available at [Nexa Center](https://neubot.nexacenter.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Github](https://github.com/neubot){:target="_blank"}.
* [NDT](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/ndt/){:target="_blank"}
  * Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) measures characteristics of a TCP connection under heavy load.
  * More information is available at [Internet2](http://software.internet2.edu/ndt/){:target="_blank"} and [Github](https://github.com/ndt-project/ndt){:target="_blank"}.
* [NPAD](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/npad/){:target="_blank"}
  * Network Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD) diagnoses issues in a network path that can degrade network performance.
  * More information is available at [UCAR](https://web.archive.org/web/20180714140225/https://www.ucar.edu/npad/){:target="_blank"} and [Github](https://github.com/npad/npad){:target="_blank"}.
* [OONI](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/ooni/){:target="_blank"}
  * OONI measures censorship, surveillance, and traffic manipulation on the Internet.
  * More information is available at [OONI](https://ooni.torproject.org/){:target="_blank"}
* [Paris Traceroute](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/paris-traceroute/){:target="_blank"}
  * Paris Traceroute maps network topology between two points on the Internet.
  * More information is available at [Paris Traceroute](http://www.paris-traceroute.net/){:target="_blank"}
* [SideStream](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/sidestream/){:target="_blank"}
  * SideStream collects TCP state information about completed TCP connections on a system.
  * More information is available on [Github](https://github.com/npad/sidestream){:target="_blank"}.

#### non-ETL Processed

* [BISmark](http://uploads.projectbismark.net/){:target="_blank"}
* [MobiPerf](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/openmobiledata_public){:target="_blank"}

  * The SamKnows performance testing platform is used by the USA's Federal Communications Commission (FCC), European Commission, UK government (Ofcom), Brazilian government (Anatel), Singapore's IDA and other government-backed studies worldwide.
  * SamKnows infrastructure includes off-net test servers hosted by M-Lab, and the M-Lab and SamKnows teams coordinate regularly to support the various regulatory reporting periods of data collection conducted by SamKnows.

### Measurement Data (Platform Data)

* [M-Lab Collectd](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/utilization/){:target="_blank"}
  * mlab-collectd is a monitoring tool for M-Lab slices, which collects resource utilization information about all M-Lab servers.
  * More information is available on [Github](https://github.com/m-lab/collectd-mlab){:target="_blank"}.
* [M-Lab DISCO Switch Telemetry Data](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/switch/){:target="_blank"}
  * Since June 2016, M-Lab has collected high resolution switch telemetry for each M-Lab server and site uplink. The **DIS**card **CO**llection (a.k.a. DISCO) dataset is also published as a standard M-Lab BigQuery table: `measurement-lab.base_tables.switch`
  * Our [blog post announcing this dataset]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/disco-dataset/#new-disco-switch-telemetry-dataset) provides more information about the DISCO dataset.

### Historical Data Sets (e.g. Retired Tests)

* [Glasnost](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/glasnost/){:target="_blank"} (**deprecated**)
  * Glasnost detects prioritization or censorship of network traffic.
  * More information is available at [MPI SWS](http://broadband.mpi-sws.org/transparency/bttest-mlab.php){:target="_blank"} and [Github](https://github.com/marcelscode/glasnost){:target="_blank"}.
* [pathload2](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/archive-measurement-lab/pathload2/){:target="_blank"} (**deprecated**)
