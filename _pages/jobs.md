## Contract Opportunities with M-Lab

**10/15/2019**
M-Lab is seeking a contract developer to improve and build new features for a web application called Piecewise. This application is a public engagement portal, providing a web-based survey, M-Lab NDT test, and asks the user to consent to share their location to enable fine grained spatial aggregation of the data. Deployments of this application have enabled communities to gather their own data to support policy advocacy at the local level. Most recently, the MERIT network in Michigan used Piecewise in a pilot to study the homework gap in their state (https://mi.broadbandtest.us/).

We now have funding to support taking Piecewise from a prototype application to a containerized or Software as Service product. This will enable more communities to easily deploy and use M-Lab tools and data for their advocacy, research, or public engagement.

If you are interested in learning more, please review the [work scope]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/2019-2020_Piecewise_SOW.pdf), which describes the current application state, roadmap, and timeline; and reach out to M-Lab Community Lead, Chris Ritzo (critzo@measurementlab.net), or M-Lab Director, Lai Yi Ohlsen (laiyi@measurementlab.net).
