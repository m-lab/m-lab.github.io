# Supporting or Contributing to M-Lab

M-Lab welcomes the participation of individuals and researchers, as well as companies, organizations, and other institutions, that would like to help expand the platform and ensure its growth and success.

## Develop a Test

Researchers developing and maintaining open source network measurement tests may apply to host a new test on M-Lab. If your project fits within M-Lab's guidelines and principles, we invite you to [apply for M-Lab hosting](https://docs.google.com/a/opentechinstitute.org/forms/d/1Dz-d8bs92ltlKKxWDCoi2nFC6wmBrBq6vrLIwhYyiDM/viewform).

Please review the documents below before applying:

* [M-Lab's conceptual and technical scope and policies]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/mlab-founding-vision.pdf)
* [M-Lab's roles & responsibilities for new researchers]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/mlab-roles-responsibilities.pdf)
* [M-Lab's requirements and procedures for accepting new tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/mlab-procedures-new-tools.pdf)

## Use an M-Lab Test in Your Website or Application

M-Lab's open source tests can be added to your website, mobile application, or other software, providing a service to your users and allowing M-Lab to reach more people and generate more data. If you are considering building an M-Lab test into your website or application, you should be familiar with M-Lab's [Privacy]({{ site.basurl }}/privacy) and [Acceptable Use]({{ site.baseurl }}/aup) policies.

You can find out more information in our FAQ article: [How can I add an M-Lab test to my website, mobile app, or other software?]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq/#how-can-i-add-an-m-lab-test-to-my-website-app-or-other-software), in our [data documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/docs), or [contact us](mailto:support@measurementlab.net) to learn more.

## Host or Sponsor an M-Lab Measurement Site

M-Lab supporting partners may contribute or donate resources to provide new measurement points around the world. If you are interested in helping M-Lab expand our coverage to new areas, please submit [this application](https://docs.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHNMZ2p0OU5TckxIUFg0RVNhSk5teEE6MQ#gid=0). The document [How to Deploy a New M-Lab Site]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/how-to-deploy-mlab-site.pdf) outlines the resources needed for each M-Lab Measurement Point.

If you'd like to get involved as an M-Lab supporting partner, [contact](mailto:support@measurementlab.net) the M-Lab team and join the [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss){:target="_blank"}.

## Analyze and Visualize M-Lab Data

M-Lab welcomes researchers who want to dig into the M-Lab data, providing documentation and best-effort email support. If you are interested in working with M-Lab data in your research, please review our [data documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/data) to help get you started, and [contact us](mailto:support@measurementlab.net) with any questions.
