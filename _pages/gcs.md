# Google Cloud Storage

M-Lab publishes all data it collects in raw form as archives on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) at the following location:

[https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/m-lab/](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/m-lab/){:target="_blank"}

## File Layout

All M-Lab files are packaged and compressed in [.tar format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28computing%29){:target="_blank"}. They are placed in folders and named according to the following schema:

`[tool]/[YYYY]/[MM]/[DD]/[YYYYMMDD]T[HHMMSS]-[server]-[tool]-[file index].tgz`

* `tool`: The measurement tool that generated the data
* `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS`: Start of the time window in which the data were collected
* `server`: M-Lab server that collected the data
* `file index`: Index of the file

This means that each compressed .tgz file contains all the data collected during a single day, by a single tool running on a single M-Lab server.

If the data collected during one day by one tool on one server are more than 1 GB (uncompressed), the files are split into multiple compressed .tgz files of up to 1 GB in size.

For example, the compressed .tgz file `20090218T000000Z-mlab1-lga01-ndt-0000.tgz` contains the first 1 GB of data collected by all the NDT tests that were served by the M-Lab server mlab1-lga01 on Feb 18, 2009.

## Accessing Data Programmatically

### Accessing Data with `gsutil`

The easiest way to access M-Lab data on GCS programmatically is by using the [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) command-line utility.

~~~ shell
# List the contents of the M-Lab NDT data in GCS.
$ gsutil ls -l gsutil ls -l gs://m-lab/

# Copy a file from GCS locally.
$ gsutil cp gs://m-lab/ndt/2009/02/18/20090218T000000Z-mlab1-lga01-ndt-0000.tgz .
~~~

### Accessing Data With Common HTTP Tools

The URLs shown in [M-Lab's GCS web interface](https://console.developers.google.com/storage/browser/m-lab/){:target="_blank"} require the user to be logged in, which can present challenges when attempting to access the data with common HTTP utilities like `curl` or `wget`.

You can access M-Lab files programmatically by replacing:

`storage.cloud.google.com/m/cloudstorage/b`

with

`storage.googleapis.com`

in any GCS URL.

For example, if the URL of a raw NDT archive on the GCS web application is:

[https://storage.cloud.google.com/m/cloudstorage/b/m-lab/o/ndt/2015/12/28/20151228T000000Z-mlab1-lga04-ndt-0001.tgz](https://storage.cloud.google.com/m/cloudstorage/b/m-lab/o/ndt/2015/12/28/20151228T000000Z-mlab1-lga04-ndt-0001.tgz)

You can access it without authentication via this URL:

[https://storage.googleapis.com/m-lab/ndt/2015/12/28/20151228T000000Z-mlab1-lga04-ndt-0001.tgz](https://storage.googleapis.com/m-lab/ndt/2015/12/28/20151228T000000Z-mlab1-lga04-ndt-0001.tgz)

### GCS File Index

A list of all M-Lab files in GCS is available at:

[https://storage.googleapis.com/m-lab/list/all_mlab_tarfiles.txt.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/m-lab/list/all_mlab_tarfiles.txt.gz)

This file provides gs:// URLs to M-Lab data.

To change these URLs to https:// URLs (compatible with common HTTP tools), you can convert the file using the following [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) script:

~~~ shell
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/m-lab/list/all_mlab_tarfiles.txt.gz | gunzip | \
while read; do echo ${REPLY/gs:\/\//https://storage.googleapis.com/}; done
~~~
