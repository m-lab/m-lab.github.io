# Paris Traceroute

Paris Traceroute collects network path information for every connection used by the measurement tests running on the M-Lab platform. In addition to the route and network topology data provided by regular traceroute, Paris Traceroute detects load balancing, noting when a transmission is split between two paths. Like SideStream, Paris Traceroute runs when another M-Lab test makes a connection with the platform.
