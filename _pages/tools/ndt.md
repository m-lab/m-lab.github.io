# NDT (Network Diagnostic Test)

NDT (Network Diagnostic Test) provides a sophisticated speed and diagnostic test suitable for both the novice and the network researcher. NDT reports upload and download speeds and attempts to determine what problems limit speeds. It also provides detailed diagnostic reporting on what it finds. While the diagnostic messages are most useful for expert users, they can also help novice users by allowing them to provide detailed trouble reports to their network administrator.

There are two supported ways to **run an NDT test**: via this web page (see below) or via a Unix command-line tool (see link to the NDT source code below).

NOTE: If the test does not run or takes longer than 60 seconds, please read the FAQ entry, "[How do I report issues with M-Lab tests]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq/#how-do-i-report-issues-with-m-lab-tests)"
