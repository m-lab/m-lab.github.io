# NDT (Network Diagnostic Test)

NDT (Network Diagnostic Tool) provides a sophisticated speed and
diagnostic test suitable for both the novice and the network researcher.
Not only does NDT report upload and download speeds, it also attempts to
determine what problems limited speeds, and provides details diagnostic
reporting on what it found. While the diagnostic messages are most
useful for expert users, they can also help novice users by allowing
them to provide detailed trouble reports to their network administrator.

## Run NDT

There are two supported ways to run an NDT test: via this web page below
or via a Unix command-line tool.

NOTE: if the test does not run or takes longer than 60 seconds, please
read the [FAQ entry](http://www.measurementlab.net/faq) for "troubleshooting
the NDT speed test".
