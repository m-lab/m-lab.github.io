# Neubot

Neubot (the network neutrality bot) is a free software Internet bot, developed and maintained by the Nexa Center for Internet & Society, that gathers network performance data useful to investigate network neutrality. Once installed, it runs in the background and periodically performs active transmission tests with M-Lab servers. Three tests are currently implemented: "speedtest," which emulates HTTP; "bittorrent", which emulates BitTorrent; and "raw," which performs a raw TCP test.
