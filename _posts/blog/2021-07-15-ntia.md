The National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s (NTIA) recently
released a new public map, the [Indicators of Broadband Need][ntia]. It’s an
excellent, publicly available resource to help communities as they plan how and
where to improve broadband services for their residents. Both the public
indicators map and the NTIA’s National Broadband Availability Map (NBAM)
platform pull together publicly available data sources on broadband, including
the American Community Survey from the US Census Bureau, the FCC’s Form 477
provider reports, aggregate speed test data from Ookla and M-Lab, and aggregate
application level speed measurements from Microsoft. The NBAM tool in general
has been available to state and tribal governments’ broadband offices for some
time now, so it’s really great to see the Indicators of Broadband Need resource
available publicly.

One of the new data layers in both the Indicators of Broadband Need map and the
NBAM tool is from Measurement Lab (M-Lab). NTIA is showing the median upload and
download rates by US county between January and June 2020, as measured by the
Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT). The inclusion of NDT aggregate data from M-Lab is
the result of our collaboration and support of NTIA since 2018. NTIA was
directed by Congress in 2018 with updating the [National Broadband Availability
Map][nbam] with third party datasets related to broadband services in the US, in
coordination with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

To get this data into the Indicators of Broadband Need map and NBAM platform,
NTIA is using methods and queries adapted from our [statistics API service][stats-api], which
we soft-launched earlier this year. The statistics API currently provides
aggregated statistics by geography based on our own [set of recommendations][analysis-recommendations] for
how to best use NDT data in policy & advocacy analyses. Recognizing that people
and organizations often do not have the expertise themselves to analyze data
from large datasets like ours, we developed these recommendations and the
statistics API in an effort to properly represent this data, and to provide
correct context on how it compares and contrasts to other, similar looking
datasets, such as the FCC’s Form 477 data and median speed measurements from
Ookla.

To make the most of all of this data, it is important to consider the nuances of each dataset, specifically how they relate to one another, and to the 25/3 broadband standard (and future standards) in general. **Though Ookla and NDT both measure “speeds” and “latency”, each test and each platform have different methodologies and server topologies. Therefore, their results have similar metrics, but technically don’t measure the same things.** Similarly, the Microsoft measurements collected when people access their online services or updates present yet another methodology, but with the same metrics of upload and download speeds.

Having these data in a tool alongside other publicly available data sources to compare with the FCC’s Form 477 provider reports is a really excellent resource for communities planning how to best prioritize where to focus infrastructure money from state and federal programs. That said, it’s important to understand that different measurements tell us different things, and aren’t the same. Aside from the methodologies, the terms themselves are nuanced and the whole landscape of assessing the speeds, latency, and quality of service that people receive has been highly politicized. Our goal at M-Lab is to explain what NDT measurements are, and how they compare/contrast with other data sources. 

So let’s dig into some details to understand the differences and context to the various datasets in the NTIA Indicators of Broadband Need Map, as well as our understanding of how each relates to the 25/3 national broadband standard.

Measuring the National Broadband Standard - 25 Mbps Download, 3 Mbps Upload
It’s useful to start with a base understanding of the 25/3 broadband standard, and how the FCC measures that annually. We’re well familiar with their Form 477 provider reports, but the agency also runs an annual measurement study to assess connectivity of the service tiers of participating providers. In terms of how the FCC measures whether providers are meeting the 25/3 standard, it’s the Measuring Broadband America (MBA) program that is linked in the FCC’s Broadband Speed Guide and the Household Broadband Guide for more information about speeds related to the standard. The MBA measurement program is the closest thing to a federal measurement standard assessing the 25/3 broadband standard. The MBA report is limited in scope to ISPs who voluntarily participate and provides aggregate measurements of their different service tiers across a nationwide sample rather than specific geographic areas of the US. In 2019 for example, 10 ISPs participated in the study, across 12 access technologies. Data was collected from 2,931 volunteer panelists selected to be geographically diverse over the four Census regions in the US. Measurements for the annual study are collected for a two month period for the study, followed by analysis and reporting [ 1 ]. 

The MBA program places a router at the homes of participating subscribers, across various service plans and access media. The router software runs a variety of measurements over a defined period of time for each annual study, and the aggregated results are published in a report covering that year’s results. The measurements included in the MBA program reports are conducted from consumer subscription locations to servers hosted, “outside the network boundaries of the participating ISPs.” [ 2 ] This is called an “off-net” topology, referring to how servers are located in relation to the location where the tests are initiated. Additionally, some ISPs participating in the program host “on-net” test servers within their networks, which are used within the MBA program to, “provide additional validity checks and insight into broadband service performance within an ISP’s network.” [ 3 ] The MBA program collects multiple measurement tests which are described in the Technical Appendix of the latest MBA report. [ 4 ] Of note to this discussion, the download and upload speed measurements use three TCP connections during the measurement, as we’ll discuss in more detail below. 

The structure of the MBA program can help us understand the ways in which the broadband standard is framed at the federal level in terms of measurement, but it’s also only part of the landscape of Internet measurement in the US. The program’s measurement and reporting focus on assessment of ISP speed tiers using a geographic sampling method, so it provides a good general overview of the state of ISP service for participating providers and their service tiers.
But most communities are interested in more specific and more data generally about the measured state of Internet service in their city, county, state, etc. for all ISPs in their region. And while the FCC’s Form 477 provider reports give us the advertised maximum speeds for providers at the Census block level, it’s well known that this data is not representative in many cases, as it is self-reported by providers without validation. The FCC is currently working to update their process for data to undergird its current broadband maps through their Broadband Data Collection program [ 5 ]. This is where crowdsourced measurement platforms like Ookla and M-Lab have filled a gap in the general understanding of the state of Internet service, by enabling anyone to measure their Internet connection. These platforms themselves differ, and their tests have different methods that we’ll discuss next, but both take a similar approach to measurement as the FCC MBA program in that they use a dedicated server platform which clients or tests use for the sole purpose of measuring the connection. Other measurements such as those provided by Microsoft in the NTIA indicators of need map take a different approach, conducting measurements when applications access hosted services like Windows update [ 6 ].

Different platforms and their measurements tell us different things

While the MBA Program, Ookla, and NDT provide similar metrics (download & upload speed, and latency), their respective platform topologies and each tests’ measurement methodologies are very different. Platform topology refers to how servers are located in relation to where people running tests are located, and measurement methodology refers to how each test is designed to work and what each measures.

Related to NTIA’s data sources, we can begin to identify similarities and differences between the platform and measurements of the MBA program, Ookla, and M-Lab. First, the server location for tests in the MBA program and M-Lab NDT tests are located off-net, which might also be called “middle mile” in the general topology of the Internet. Ookla encourages third parties hosting their servers to locate them as close to their users as possible, or on-net. And while people running an Ookla test may select a specific server to test against, M-Lab and MBA don’t allow the person running the test to select an individual server.

Both NDT hosted on the M-Lab platform and the MBA program’s speed measurements are conducted between the MBA’s router within the participant’s home network and one server. As of at least May 2021, each test run from Ookla’s web, desktop, and mobile platforms use multiple (4) servers to spread the test load. [ 7 ] MBA and Ookla measurements are conducted to the server(s) closest to the tester geographically with the least latency, while M-Lab’s NDT measurements are run to the closest server geographically regardless of latency.

In addition to the differences in platform topologies, MBA, Ookla, and M-Lab, there are also differences in the test methodology each test uses. Ookla’s Speedtest.net uses multiple “streams” or connections, now spread across multiple nearby and least latent servers, in an attempt to measure the maximum access link capacity of the ISP’s network. M-Lab’s NDT test uses a single stream or connection to measure the capacity of an end-to-end path from the person running the test to the geographically closest off-net server on our platform. And the MBA program uses a multi-stream test to a single off-net server that is geographically closest and least latent.

Both single-stream and multi-stream measurements provide valuable insight into a user’s Internet performance. Multi-stream measurements, such as the one provided by Ookla and the MBA, open up multiple data streams over a user’s connection. This approach is designed to emulate a modern browser. It can also partially mask data delivery problems, such as when one set of streams pick up unused capacity left by another set of streams that are performing poorly due to packet loss or congestion elsewhere in the network. But by overcoming these sorts of problems, multiple streams are able to return measurements closer to link capacity, or the maximum amount of data can fill the link. 

Single-stream measurements do not attempt to emulate a browser, but do reflect the performance of the basic building block for nearly all applications, that is, the single streams themselves. Since separate streams cannot compensate for each other's problems they are far more sensitive to data delivery issues such as externally caused packet loss and therefore their measurements reflect an unaugmented model of TCP’s behavior. Single stream-measurements like NDT do not measure link capacity, but a measurement of TCP’s performance . In this sense NDT is a baseline measurement for a connection’s performance. At M-Lab we encourage the use of measurements of both the single and multi-stream variety and would welcome the contribution of a multi-stream test to our open source platform in the future.

The table below compares the FCC MBA program, Form 477 provider reports, M-Lab’s NDT test, and Ookla’s Speedtest.net test.
