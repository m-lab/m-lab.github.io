In late November 2018, M-Lab was invited to the Internet Measurement Workshop
at
[AFRINIC-29](https://meeting.afrinic.net/afrinic-29/about/afrinic-29){:target="_blank"}
in Tunisia and to give a keynote about M-Lab and open internet measurement at
[AFRICOMM
2018](http://africommconference2018.eai-conferences.org/){:target="_blank"}
in Senegal. Both trips were a fantastic opportunity to deepen our
relationship with researchers focused on the African internet, learn more
about how our platform is serving community needs, foster conversation around
open internet measurement, and identify opportunities for further
collaboration, research and tool development to better support the internet
measurement, research and policy community in Africa. <!--more-->

Award winning research from Amreesh Phokeer and Josiah Chavula (["Revealing
Latency Clusters in Africa"][african-latency]){:target="_blank"} highlights
how Internet routing in Africa often takes paths outside of the continent,
significantly impacting end to end latency. To facilitate this type of
research, by the end of 2019, M-Lab is committed to deploying [CAIDA's
scamper][scamper]{:target="_blank"} and unifying the BigQuery schema for both
scamper and [paris-traceroute data][traceroute]{:target="_blank"}.

But you don’t have to wait. You can begin [Exploring the African
Internet][explore]{:target="_blank"} with M-Lab now. If you have ideas, and
want to talk through how to work with M-Lab data to support your research and
analysis, join our [discuss list][discuss]{:target="_blank"} or [email the
team][support]{:target="_blank"}.
