# M-Lab at RIPE

![RIPE 69 image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/ripe.png){:.pull-right width="294" height="206"}

On Thursday Nov. 6, Collin Anderson gave a talk at the [RIPE meeting](http://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings/ripe-meetings) in London. Collin has been immersed in the M-Lab data for some time, and helped lead the recently published technical report, [ISP Interconnection and its Impact on Consumer Internet Performance]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/M-Lab_Interconnection_Study_US.pdf). He presented a lyrical overview of these research findings for the assembled crowd of network operators and researchers, which is archived on the RIPE website.
