# Measurement Lab Launches New Global Data Visualization Tools

Measurement Lab (M-Lab) has the largest collection of open internet performance [data]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/) on the planet. [Hundreds of thousands of people (and rising everyday!) test their internet connections](https://viz.measurementlab.net/) on M-Lab and provide that data to the [public domain]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/#data-license-and-citing-m-lab-data) for research, analysis and advocacy. With an extensive library of data dating back to 2009, M-Lab has over 5 petabytes of information about quality of experience on the internet contributed by people like you.<!--more-->

Over the last year, we’ve been working to improve access to our data through visualizations and [applications](https://www.newamerica.org/oti/press-releases/seattle-launches-broadband-speed-test-in-partnership-with-oti/){target="_blank"}. Towards the end of 2015, we launched the [Observatory](https://www.measurementlab.net/observatory/) to support the M-Lab Study: [ISP Interconnection and its Impact on Consumer Internet Performance]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/M-Lab_Interconnection_Study_US.pdf), which made it possible for policy makers, researchers, journalists and others to monitor and analyze data about how ISPs interconnection in the United States impacts quality of experience. But M-Lab has data from around the world and on many more ISPs, so we wanted to provide a tool that allowed anyone in the world to dig into NDT data for their location. In 2016, we launched an initiative to revamp our visualizations and move to using open source technology to make them more flexible and auditable by the community. We worked with [Bocoup](https://bocoup.com/datavis){target="_blank"} to develop a data processing [pipeline](https://github.com/m-lab/mlab-vis-pipeline){target="_blank"}, [API](https://github.com/m-lab/mlab-vis-api){target="_blank"} and [visualizations](https://github.com/m-lab/mlab-vis-client){target="_blank"} all of which contribute to making the data more explorable.

At M-Lab, we believe that an open internet is the foundation of access and innovation, where users can go where they want, when they want without discrimination, but how do we know if the internet is truly open? By designing these new visualizations, now anyone, regardless of their technical expertise, can [explore](https://viz.measurementlab.net/) how their internet experience is mediated by all of the various actors that make up the internet.

Check it out -- [search for where you live](http://viz.measurementlab.net/), [compare ISPs](https://viz.measurementlab.net/compare/location) in your area, or compare ISPs across locations.
