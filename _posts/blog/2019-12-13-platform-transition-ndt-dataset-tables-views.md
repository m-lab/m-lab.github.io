If you've been following our blog over the last few months, you know M-Lab has been working toward a complete server platform upgrade. As of November 20, 2019, all M-Lab servers are now managed by Kubernetes, running Docker container services for all experiments. This transition has greatly improved our platform management, this post addresses the short term impact on downstream data users and applications, and outlines a temporary solution and our longer term for new NDT tables/views.<!--more-->

## Platform Transition Timeline

At the end of August, the platform was ready to be fully transitioned. In September and October, we paused the platform upgrade to support the United States Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) annual [Measuring Broadband America program (MBA)](https://www.fcc.gov/general/measuring-broadband-america){:target="_blank"}. For many years, M-Lab has donated space on our servers for use by [SamKnows](https://www.samknows.com/){:target="_blank"}, the FCC's contractor for the MBA program. SamKnows has used the M-Lab platform for the MBA program's "off-net" measurements. Once the official end of the MBA data collection period was announced, the M-Lab team began upgrading the remaining servers in our fleet.

## Change in NDT data publishing dataset, tables, and views

During the staged rolling upgrade to `ndt-server` from [web100 to tcp_info]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/modernizing-mlab/), NDT test data were published to two different datasets. Our ETL pipeline made NDT tests collected by the `web100` version of the NDT server available in these BigQuery Views:

* `measurement-lab.ndt.recommended`
* `measurement-lab.ndt.downloads`
* `measurement-lab.ndt.uploads`
* `measurement-lab.ndt.web100`

As of Nov. 20, 2019, all new test data is being published to:

* `measurement-lab.ndt.ndt5`

And a new view has been created, which stores `tcpinfo` values, and client / server metadata:

* `measurement-lab.ndt.tcpinfo`

## Current impact of tcpinfo transition on queries

The transition to the new `ndt-server` completed is an accomplishment that our team is celebrating. However, we still have a little more work to do. If you've tried to query `ndt.web100`, `ndt.recommended`, `ndt.downloads`, or `ndt.uploads` recently, you may have noticed a decrease in test volume through November, with no results after November 20.

To see the impact of this transition in test counts, we can run a query to count the number of tests in each table per day over the timeline of the platform transition, roughly 2019-07-01 through 2019-11-20:

```~sql
#standardSQL
WITH
ndt_web100 AS (
  SELECT count(*) AS cnt_web100, partition_date AS web100_date
  FROM `measurement-lab.ndt.recommended`
  WHERE partition_date >= '2019-07-01'
  GROUP BY partition_date
),
ndt5_tcpinfo AS (
  SELECT count(*) AS cnt_ndt5, partition_date AS ndt5_date
  FROM `measurement-lab.ndt.ndt5`
  WHERE partition_date >= '2019-07-01'
  GROUP BY partition_date
)
SELECT * FROM ndt_web100
JOIN ndt5_tcpinfo ON ndt_web100.web100_date = ndt5_tcpinfo.ndt5_date
ORDER BY web100_date
```

The query results show decreasing daily test counts in `measurement-lab.ndt.recommended` and increasing daily test counts in `measurement-lab.ndt.ndt5` between 2019-07-18 and 2019-11-20.

All new test data are available in `measurement-lab.ndt.ndt5` and test annotations are available in `measurement-lab.net.tcpinfo`. If you need annotation fields with the test results, in the short term you must query both tables using the `UUID` field to match test rows with their annotations.

Additionally, the platform change from `web100` to `tcp_info` will likely require some changes to your queries. There are big differences in the values collected by `web100` and `tcp_info`. We have attempted to map the most common metrics and fields from each in the table below. If there are `web100` values that you previously used that are not listed below, please let us know.

## Updating your queries with data from ndt5 with tcpinfo views

To illustrate the changes brought on by the transition to `tcp_info` and the current status of the `ndt5` view, we present a before/after query below.

**Upload results using previous `web100` BigQuery views:**

```~sql
#standardSQL
SELECT
  test_id,
  FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%F %H:%m:%S', log_time) AS UTC_date_time,

  connection_spec.client_geolocation.latitude AS client_latitude,
  connection_spec.client_geolocation.longitude AS client_longitude,
  connection_spec.client_geolocation.country_code AS country_code,
  connection_spec.client_geolocation.region AS region,
  connection_spec.client_geolocation.city AS city,

## What's next?

By the end of January 2020, the M-Lab team will update the schema for `measurement-lab.ndt.ndt5`, providing unified views of NDT data collected before and after our transition to the new `ndt-server`. Until that time, we encourage users of the `ndt` dataset to retrieve test metadata from the `measurement-lab.ndt.tcpinfo` table as described above. Watch for future blog posts for updates.
