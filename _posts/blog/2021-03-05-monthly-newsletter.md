Hello! 

I hope this finds you well. Today I’m writing with the first of many newsletters
that you’ll receive on this mailing list. In each monthly edition, we’ll provide
updates about M-Lab such as changes to our platform and pipeline, data schemas,
community tools, best practice analyses, community case studies, documentation
and guides, and more. Ultimately, our goal is to communicate with you on a more
regular basis, so we encourage you to reply with any questions or comments that
come to mind. Additionally, as part of our efforts to communicate more
effectively, we’ve established a lightweight set of [community guidelines][community-guidelines] that we
ask participants to keep in mind as you engage here and on any other M-Lab
hosted forum. If there is anything you’d like to see in these newsletters,
please do let me know. And without further ado!<!--more-->

**We recently published two new blog posts.**

[Using M-Lab data in Broadband Advocacy and Policy][blogpost1] was written as a guide for researchers, policy makers, governing bodies, advocacy groups, or anyone who wants to understand M-Lab data and how it compares to other internet measurement data sets. We plan to continue to develop these recommendations for appropriate use of our data in analyses and reports. 

[Requiring access tokens for ndt7][blogpost2] announces the requirement for NDT client
integrations to use access tokens that are issued by the Locate v2 API. These
requirements are relevant to anyone supporting an NDT integration. The latest
versions of the ndt7-js, ndt7-client-go, and ndt7-client-android already support
the Locate v2 API natively. Update to the latest version and you’re done!

**Upcoming updates**

In our December 2020 community calls, we announced the development of a pipeline to ease the use of aggregate NDT statistics into third party applications. We have soft launched the pipeline to a group of early testers and plan to release to the public in the next quarter. If you are interested in early testing, please let us know. 

**Contract opportunities**

We currently have two projects that we are looking for a Javascript developer to
complete.  You can read more about them [here][developer-contract]. Please reach
out to laiyi@measurementlab.net if you are interested.
