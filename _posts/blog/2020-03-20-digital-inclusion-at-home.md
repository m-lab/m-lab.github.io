As COVID-19’s impact increases globally, more people are working, learning and living online. In partnership with NDIA, X-Lab, ILSR and Marconi Society, Measurement Lab has set up a [speed test portal](http://speed.digitalinclusion.org/){:target="_blank"} to collect geolocated data with an accompanying survey focused on Digital Inclusion @ Home.<!--more-->

The portal uses [Piecewise](https://github.com/m-lab/piecewise){:target="_blank"}, an open-source public engagement portal that collects both user-volunteered survey responses and speed test data using the Measurement Lab platform. M-Lab has developed the tool to its current iteration in partnership with several partners over the years, most recently the [Michigan Moonshot](https://www.merit.edu/services/moonshot/){:target="_blank"} initiative and the [Institute of Local Self Reliance](https://ilsr-nc.measuringbroadband.org/){:target="_blank"}’s research in North Carolina. Piecewise is currently in development to enable its management as a SAAS app by mid 2020. You can read more about our [plans for the tool](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p4KggaWi6m0y35qe94gUm96Ef_NUTx4LylMJc3RDJbY/edit){:target="_blank"}.

You can [take the survey and speed test](http://speed.digitalinclusion.org/){:target="_blank"} and get more information about the initiative here. If you would like more information about becoming a Supporting Partner, please reach out to support@measurementlab.net.
