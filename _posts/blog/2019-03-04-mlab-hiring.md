Hello M-Lab Community!

{:.offset-box}
TLDR; Interested in working with M-Lab? We are hiring a Project Director and have opportunities for contracts! Check out the [job description]({{ site.baseurl }}/jobs/) and more information about the [contract]({{ site.baseurl }}/jobs/), and apply by March 31st!
<!--more-->

As you may have seen, M-Lab recently [moved over to Code for Science & Society]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/mlab-announcement/#after-a-decade-of-growth,-measurement-lab-spins-out-of-new-america-to-join-code-for-science-&-society). One change that might not have been as visible is that I also recently moved into a [new role over at Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/blog/hello-georgia){:target="_blank"}. For those of you whom I’ve worked with over the years on many M-Lab related projects — it’s important to note, that I’m still involved at M-Lab, I’m just moving out of my role in the day to day management, and instead still involved in some specific projects and in strategy and governance of M-Lab.

As a result, we are looking for someone new to join the team and help lead the work, based out of our fiscal sponsor [Code for Science & Society](https://codeforscience.org){:target="_blank"}! The [full job description]({{ site.baseurl }}/jobs/) is available on our [new jobs & opportunities page]({{ site.baseurl }}/jobs/), so read more there!

[The M-Lab project director]({{ site.baseurl }}/jobs/) is responsible for managing the Measurement Lab project at Code for Science & Society (CS&S).

## Contract: Measuring Library Broadband Networks Project

We are also excited to announce an opportunity to collaborate around our [Measuring Library Broadband Networks](http://slis.simmons.edu/blogs/mlbn/){:target="_blank"} project, supported by the Institute for Museum and Library Services and in partnership with Simmons University and Internet2. As part of that project, we are developing an open toolkit to enable libraries and other communities to deploy measurement clients on small onboard computers, e.g. RaspberryPis or ODroids. We are looking for help developing that toolkit. Read [more about the specific needs]({{ site.baseurl }}/jobs/) of the project, and send us your proposals to [contact@measurementlab.net](mailto:contact@measurementlab.net) by March 31st, 2019.
