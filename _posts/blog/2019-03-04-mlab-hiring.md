As you may have seen, M-Lab recently [moved over to Code for Science & Society]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/mlab-announcement/). One change that might not have been as visible is that I also recently moved into a [new role over at Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/blog/hello-georgia){:target="_blank"}. For those of you whom I've worked with over the years on many M-Lab related projects â€” It's important to note, that I'm still involved at M-Lab, I'm just moving out of my role in the day to day management, and instead still involved in some specific projects and in strategy and governance of M-Lab.

As a result, we are looking for someone new to join the team and help lead the work, based out of our fiscal sponsor [Code for Science & Society](https://codeforscience.org){:target="_blank"}! The full job description is available on our [new jobs & opportunities page]( {{ site.baseurl }}/jobs/), so read more there!
